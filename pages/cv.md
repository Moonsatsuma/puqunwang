## About myself

My name is Puqun Wang. I was trained in Materials Sciences and Engineering and went on earning a Ph.D degree in the field of Silicon Photovoltaics. During my Ph.d, I conducted a systematic study on periodic nanostructures for enhancing light trapping in thin Silicon solar cells. After my Ph.D, I continued working at the solar energy research institute to learn more about fabrication and characterisation of silicon solar cells. In the past four years, I have worked on the topics of TOPCon and Heterojunction solar cells and built up comprehensive knowledge on the fabrication and characterisation of silicon solar cells. 
The year 2020 is a transition year for me, and probably so for a lot of people. After working in the field for 8 years, I developed an urge to move to the next stage of my career. Compared to "me" eight years ago, I am definitely more mature, both academically and personally. I also lost the excitement of learning when I began my Ph.D studies. I also want "meaning" now. 

大家好，我是一个在新加坡生活的中国人。大学时的专业是材料科学与工程。毕业以后我接着读了一个博士，课题是太阳能电池。
## About the site
When I look back from this point, the way that I developed from a Ph.D student to a young researcher is probably not different from others. However, I have been lonely and could only see "me" along the way. I wished that someone has shared their personal feelings with me in the past years. So I decided to start a site and write down my experiences and struggles during my Ph.D years and as a young researcher now.
